Hi, I’m Kulbir Singh Ahluwalia, a Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign ([UIUC](https://illinois.edu/)). As a Graduate Research Assistant at the Distributed Autonomous Systems Laboratory (DASLAB), I am working with Professor Girish Chowdhary and Professor Julia Hockenmaier on voice-controlled CNC gardening robots using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.

<!-- at the Robotics Algorithms & Autonomous Systems (RAAS) Lab 
https://raaslab.org/index.html-->

I graduated with my Master’s in Robotics from the University of Maryland where I worked with Professor Pratap Tokekar and Professor Ryan Williams on “Pasture Monitoring in Simulated Environments”. My research at UMD involved coming up with novel approaches for simulating custom pasturelands reasonably fast using parallel processing and processing dense point clouds for height estimation of pastures. Our work for long-term Spatio-temporal prediction of pasture heights using deep learning and the use of multi-robot deployment policy for pasture monitoring has been published in [Agronomy](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/11/11/2245) and under review at [IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09203) respectively.

Apart from research, I like meditating, working out, gardening, singing and play the guitar once a month. On the gardening side, I'm currently trying to clone my favourite orchid phalaenopsis which I've had since 3 years now.

 <!-- I'm good at cooking tasty dishes from whatever is available in the fridge. -->


<!-- My research interests include NLP for voice-controlled agricultural robots, multi-robot planning, autonomous vehicle navigation in unknown environments with uncertainty and applied computer vision. I'm learning to use RL for multi-agent systems, high-level planning and DL for computer vision applications. -->
