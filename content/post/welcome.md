First Blog post
We can add a formula using LaTeX: $y = x^2 + 3*\alpha$


The mass-energy equivalence is described by the famous equation
\begin{equation}
E=mc^2
\end{equation}


discovered in 1905 by Albert Einstein. 
In natural units ($c$ = 1), the formula expresses the identity

\begin{equation}
E=m
\end{equation}
